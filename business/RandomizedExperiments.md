In the book [Black Bock Thinking](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?ie=UTF8&keywords=black+box+thinking+book&tag=googhydr-21&index=aps&hvadid=188177554229&hvpos=1t1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13453648369175995917&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=b&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=20343&hvlocphy=1005419&hvtargid=kwd-153621342498&ref=pd_sl_95a2o8f21i_b), Matthew Syed describes the role of [Randomized controlled trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial) (RCT) in the medical industry and how it undoubtely has saved lives over the years. What's interesting is that it is used to great extend by some of the very successful companies; 

- In 2010, Google did 12,000 RCTs to test everything from Ad placements to colors used in the Google toolbar.
- Capital One uses thousands of RCTs to determine which rates to offer, and how they are offered. 

Given the vast amount of data available to base future decisions on, isn't it enough to just examine historical metrics to determine what a change might bring? The problem is that big data can provide clues about past behaviour but it will not tell us how they will react to bold changes [*](https://hbr.org/2014/12/the-discipline-of-business-experimentation).
