# Volatility

Volatility is the degree of variation of trading prices as measured by the [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) of [logarithmic returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return#Logarithmic).

Log return is additive, if you go up 10% one day, then down 10% the next, you end up with the same price as you started. _For example;_

| Log return   | Price  |
| ------------ | ------ |
|              | 5.00   |
| +10%         | 5.53   |
| -10%         | 5.00   |

Compare this with an standard arithmetic return;

| Arithmetic return | Price  |
| ----------------- | ------ |
|                   | 5.00   |
| +10%              | 5.50   |
| -10%              | 4.95   |

## Historical volatility vs. implied volatility

**Historical volatility** (HV), or statistical volatility, is a measure of price changes over a predetermined period of time. It is used to compare the volatility of one stock with that of another, or to the stock itself over a period of time.

**Implied volatility** (IV) is often interpreted as the marketâ€™s expectation for the future volatility of a stock. Implied volatility can be derived from the price of an option. The [CBOE Volatility Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIX) (VIX) is a popular measure of S&P 500 volatility. It is calculated based on weighted set of options and reflects the expected stock market volatility 30 days in the future. By definition, high VIX (high implied volatility) means that the market is expecting a big move that hasn't happened yet.
