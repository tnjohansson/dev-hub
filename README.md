## Floating point numbers

_The term floating point refers to the fact that a number's radix point (decimal point, or, more commonly in computers, binary point) can "float"; that is, it can be placed anywhere relative to the significant digits of the number._ [[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic)]
